<h3><u>A Little About The Honey Bee</u></h3> 

    <!-- about the honey bee-->

<p>The Honey bee is an extrordinary insect that lives in many climates and areas on our planet ranging from Europe all the way to the Arctic Circle. They live in large colonies with many of their kind in nests made of wax called hives. Honeybees are great pollinators, or a species who moves the pollen of one plant to another. This process is very important to many life forms on the planet. Cross pollination from bees benefits at least 30% of all crops. Without bees to spread seeds, and pollinate many plants, including food crops will die off.</p>
